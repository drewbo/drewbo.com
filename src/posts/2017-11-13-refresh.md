I've done a pretty bad job of updating my blog for the past three years:
it's pretty hard to run from a technical perspective and my "technical side
projects" largely became my "job". But I'm starting it back up again.

The site is now written with [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
instead of [`reStructuredText`](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html).
The CSS is much smaller and all my own code as opposed to a [theme](https://github.com/fjavieralba/flasky).
It's built with [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/) instead of [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/). The build is done automatically via [CircelCI](https://circleci.com/), replacing my previous manual (error-prone)
process.
