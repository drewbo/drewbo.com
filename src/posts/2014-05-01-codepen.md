title: Adding Codepen

This week, I've been spending my free time trying to read everything
that [Mike Bostock](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/), creator of the
JavaScript visualization library [D3.js](http://d3js.org/), has ever
written. I have a handful of trinkets/experiments that
I'm hosting on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/) while I try to get a handle
on the library. I've added a link to the footer of my site in case
you're interested in checking out what I'm working on. My [current
project](http://codepen.io/drewbo/full/BCmof/) is an extension of my
last blog post and involves creating a new visualization (for me at
least) for Ken Pomeroy's college basketball data.
