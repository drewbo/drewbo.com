I'm going to start writing this new website using [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.3.0/), which uses [Python](http://www.python.org/) to generate static websites from [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html). The [theme](https://github.com/fjavieralba/flasky) is borrowed from [fjavieralba](http://fjavieralba.com/) which I will continue to customize to suit my needs as necessary. New content coming soon (when I figure out how to use all of this).
