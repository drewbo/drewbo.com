I've been really busy the past month (hence the giant break in posts)
but I have some good excuses\! I'm also going to use this post to kick
off a series of monthly personal updates mixed in with my more
project-based posts.

Here's why I wasn't updating for a month:

  - I [ran
    a 50K](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/27150206/20140607_061238.jpg).
  - I started a [new
    job](http://developmentseed.org/blog/2014/06/16/drew-joins-developmentseed/).
  - My neighbor's apartment flooded...
  - which led to [very minor
    damage](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/27150206/20140706_140212.jpg)
    to our unit...
  - but they still decided to [pull our floors
    out](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/27150206/20140708_182915.jpg)...
  - so I've been [staying in a
    hotel](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/27150206/20140706_143623.jpg)
    for a few weeks.
  - I went to
    [Summerfest](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/27150206/20140629_185413.jpg)
    with my family.
  - I saw a [Nationals
    game](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/27150206/20140605_181246.jpg)
    followed by a [Plain White T's
    concert](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/27150206/20140605_193149.jpg).
  - I showed my [Aunt and
    Uncle](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/27150206/IMG_0298.JPG)
    around for their first visit to DC.

July and August should have some highlights as well but hopefully I'm
back into my apartment soon and I'll have more time to spend with the
site.
