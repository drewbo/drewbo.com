### The Set-Up

This past weekend, I updated the blog for the [first time in a while](http://drewbo.com/blog/2014/11/08/more-hotels-and-traveling/). I do web development now at work, and while I'm still inexperienced, it was pretty jarring to return to my site and see how inefficiently I had set up the workflow for updating it.

*from http://xkcd.com/1172/*

My old workflow involved two separate repositories: one for the content, plug-ins, configuration files for building the site (I use [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.5.0/)), and a separate repository for the deployed site. This seemed suboptimal because it meant that I had to maintain two separate repositories and when I wanted to deploy, I had to copy the output folder from one to the other. I *really* wanted to use the [`git subtree push`](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Tools-Subtree-Merging) command like I do in the office[<sup>[1]</sup>](#footnote-1).

I thought that this was going to be a short, straight-forward operation: delete the old deployment repository, add a `gh-pages` branch to my old content repo, then the magic command: `git subtree push --prefix output origin gh-pages`.

I thought wrong.

Anyway, I did end up getting this all to work but it took about three hours.

### A Parallel

At the same time, I was watching the first half of the Michigan-Northwestern football game. Both teams were playing very poorly and because the scored stayed 0-0 for so long, it became known as the 'M00N' game on twitter:

When the game finally ended with Trevor Simian, Northwestern's quarterback, falling over on a 2-pt conversion to lose the game, I noticed some remarkable parallels with my current website task: everything was terrible the whole time but eventually the 'good guys' (Me, Michigan) won. I thought about extending this metaphor further but by the time I started this post, I really didn't want to relive any of the game again.

The real reason I wanted to write after undergoing this 'ordeal' was so that I wouldn't forget how to do all these steps again and maybe help someone else out with similar issues.

### 5 Things I Learned Last Saturday

#### 1. User pages serve out of master branch

I thought all GitHub repositories served off of the `gh-pages` branch. This is [not true](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/#user--organization-pages).

#### 2. There are multiple ways to deal with unruly subtree pushes

If everything is going well, the 'standard' `git subtree push --prefix output origin master` command works fine. But sometimes you'll see this:

```bash
error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:drewbo/drewbo.com.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because a pushed branch tip is behind its remote
hint: counterpart. Check out this branch and integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g. 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details
```

You might not have the "served" branch on your local machine so it's not as simple as just doing `git pull`. My three solutions, in order of how I try them:

1. Magic Command

    ``git push origin `git subtree split --prefix build_folder master`:gh-pages --force``

    I don't totally understand this but sometimes it works (h/t [some blog](http://stevenclontz.com/blog/2014/05/08/git-subtree-push-for-deployment/))

2. Pull Request

    Do the subtree push to a temporary branch and then merge that to master/gh-pages (whatever branch hosts your output files).

3. Delete gh-pages/master (remote and locally)

    Then rebuild and push.

#### 3. DNS changes take time to propagate. Chill

- Any time you make DNS changes with your domain name, just wait a bit.
- Maybe use the DNS Lookup Utility if you're [impatient](http://linux.die.net/man/1/dig)
- [Don't screw up your email](http://imakewebthings.com/blog/github-pages-email/)

#### 4. Git submodules are confusing the first time you try them

Especially when you put submodules in submodules. [This article](https://chrisjean.com/git-submodules-adding-using-removing-and-updating/) was a big help.

#### 5. Always check `.gitignore`

I was ignoring the `output` folder in `.gitignore` which I seem to do pretty often. This was a boilerplate `.gitignore` from another project and many times you don't want to commit the output but if you're going to do the subtree push, you need it.

<div class="footnotes">
1. <a name="footnote-1"></a> my even older deployment workflow involved zipping the output folder so I could more easily upload it to the remote hosting server and then copying it over the prior files. It was a huge pain but I made the move to GitHub hosting back in July.
