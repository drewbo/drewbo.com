So it's been a little while since I posted. From my last post: "...but
hopefully I'm back into my apartment soon and I'll have more time to
spend with the site." This did not turn out to be true. Explanations for
my absence in photographic form after the jump.

Life:

  - My original hotel was sold out one night so I had to move to a [new
    hotel](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/27150206/October%20Blog%20Post/20140730_200614.jpg).
  - Went to Bosnia for a week for work. We [worked a lot during the
    day](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/27150206/October%20Blog%20Post/20140821_155127.jpg)
    but got to [explore
    Sarajevo](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/27150206/October%20Blog%20Post/20140823_144922.jpg)
    a little more afterwards. It's [incredibly
    beautiful](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/27150206/October%20Blog%20Post/20140824_130919.jpg).
  - A quick stop in Luxembourg and a quaint train ride through [the
    German
    countryside](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/27150206/October%20Blog%20Post/20140825_130800.jpg)
    on the way home.
  - Was supposed to return to my apartment but it [still wasn't
    fixed](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/27150206/October%20Blog%20Post/20140803_104656.jpg)
    so... [another
    hotel](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/27150206/October%20Blog%20Post/20140825_204811.jpg).
  - [Finally
    back\!](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/27150206/October%20Blog%20Post/20140831_135218.jpg)
  - Chicago for a
    [wedding](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/27150206/October%20Blog%20Post/20141003_204238.jpg)
  - Quick weekend in NYC where I accidentally switched bags with
    someone. His bag looked like
    [this](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/27150206/October%20Blog%20Post/20141018_112205.jpg)
    and mine looked [like
    this](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/27150206/October%20Blog%20Post/20141018_164856.jpg).

No hopeful proclamations this time about my next post. Just happy to
have an apartment again.
