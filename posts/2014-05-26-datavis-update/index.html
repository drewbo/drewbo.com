      <p>I&#39;ve made some more updates to my <a href="/kenpom-drama">KenPom
visualization</a> and used it to capture a
few observations (perhaps very obvious ones) from the last year in
college basketball.</p>
<p>The visualization still isn&#39;t a masterpiece of graphic design but it&#39;s
at a point where it&#39;s largely functional and I&#39;d like to move on to
some other projects for the time being. There are more explanations on
the page itself so <a href="/kenpom-drama">check it out</a> and
let me know what you think in the comments or via email/twitter. A
reminder that the visualization is only exploratory and isn&#39;t an attempt
to find correlations between the x and y axis (or the circle radius).</p>
<h2 id="three-observations">Three Observations</h2>
<p>Here are some things I noticed while building and playing with the
visualization, let me know if you find any other good stories in the
comments:</p>
<h3 id="1-kentucky-wichita-state-was-the-best-game-of-the-ncaa-tournament-and-probably-the-whole-season-">1. Kentucky - Wichita State was the &quot;best&quot; game of the NCAA Tournament (and probably the whole season)</h3>
<p><img src="/images/Kentucky-Wichita-St.png" alt="Kentucky Wichita St. Data
Visualization"></p>
<p>&quot;Best&quot; is a tricky term to define when talking about sports in general.
But anyone watching this game could tell you that the numbers confirm
what they saw: two lauded teams, a game that remained close throughout,
and plenty of offense. The statistics don&#39;t even account for the
&quot;Wichita State can&#39;t do it against real competition&quot; media meme which
probably upped the stakes even more prior to tipoff. This game shows up
in the top-right hand corner of the visualization and has a Hype rating
of 9 so I was glad to see the data I was using match my experience of
watching the game. Although it didn&#39;t have the highest
<a href="http://drewbo.com/blog/2014/04/28/kenpom-drama/">Drama</a> score of the
tournament (that was Wisconsin-Arizona), the pace and scoring made the
game a lot more compelling.</p>
<h3 id="2-the-big-ten-and-sec-both-had-a-particularly-nail-biting-march-madness">2. The Big Ten and SEC both had a particularly nail-biting March Madness</h3>
<p><img src="/images/Kentucky-Michigan.png" alt="Kentucky Michigan Data Visualization"></p>
<p><img src="/images/Tennessee-Iowa.png" alt="Tennessee Iowa Data Visualization"></p>
<p>In part due to three crazy games between them (Kentucky-Michigan,
Kentucky-Wisconsin, and Tennessee-Iowa), both the Big Ten and the SEC
have many tournament games off to the right side of the graph (high
Drama scores). I&#39;m not positive which conference actually had the
highest average Drama or eFG% but I may pull that in the future to test
whether this is a purely visual phenomenon. Shout out to the A10 for
having some barn burners as well despite being less heralded. Tournament
darling Dayton contributed to this but also St. Joseph&#39;s, who <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/eye-on-college-basketball/24516910/saint-josephs-was-one-rebound-away-from-killing-uconns-story">nearly
knocked
out</a>
eventual champions Connecticut in the first round.</p>
<h3 id="3-syracuse-duke-part-1-delivered-on-the-hype">3. Syracuse - Duke (part 1) delivered on the hype</h3>
<p><img src="/images/Syracuse-Duke.png" alt="Syracuse Duke Data Visualization"></p>
<p>The most &quot;hyped&quot; game of the year, according to <a href="../2014-05-05-first-datavis/">my somewhat flawed
  metric</a>, was the
  first Syracuse-Duke matchup as the teams entered as the number 2 and
  3 ranked KenPom squads respectively. The AP ratings were a bit more
  divergent (2 and 17) but I don&#39;t think anyone was exactly
  discounting Duke coming into this game. And according to the lede of
  the AP story:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>SYRACUSE, N.Y. -- Coach K said he hoped this game would live up to
its billing. It did, and then some.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was definitely among the most dramatic games (top 2%) and the eFG%
was surprisingly high for a Syracuse game (top 15%) making it a very
noticeable large dot on the chart.</p>
