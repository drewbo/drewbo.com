<p>This past weekend, I updated the blog for the first time in a while. I do web development now at work, and while I'm still inexperienced, it was pretty jarring to return to my site and see how inefficiently I had set up the workflow for updating it.</p>
<figure>

<p>My old workflow involved two separate repositories: one for the content, plug-ins, configuration files for building the site (I use <a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.5.0/">Pelican</a>), and a separate repository for the deployed site. This seemed suboptimal because it meant that I had to maintain two separate repositories and when I wanted to deploy, I had to copy the output folder from one to the other. I <em>really</em> wanted to use the <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Tools-Subtree-Merging" class="lang-highlight"><code class="hljs">git subtree push</code></a> command like I do in the office<a href="#footnote-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.</p>
<p class="lang-highlight">I thought that this was going to be a short, straight-forward operation: delete the old deployment repository, add a <code class="hljs">gh-pages</code> branch to my old content repo, then the magic command: <code>git subtree push --prefix output origin gh-pages</code>.</p>
<p>I thought wrong.</p>

<p>Anyway, I did end up getting this all to work but it took about three hours.</p>
<h3 id="a-parallel">A Parallel</h3>
<p>At the same time, I was watching the first half of the Michigan-Northwestern football game. Both teams were playing very poorly and because the scored stayed 0-0 for so long, it became known as the 'M00N' game on twitter:</p>
<figure>

</figure>

<p>When the game finally ended with Trevor Simian, Northwestern's quarterback, falling over on a 2-pt conversion to lose the game, I noticed some remarkable parallels with my current website task: everything was terrible the whole time but eventually the 'good guys' (Me, Michigan) won. I thought about extending this metaphor further but by the time I started this post, I really didn't want to relive any of the game again.</p>
<p>The real reason I wanted to write after undergoing this 'ordeal' was so that I wouldn't forget how to do all these steps again and maybe help someone else out with similar issues.</p>
<h3 id="5-things-i-learned-last-saturday">5 Things I Learned Last Saturday</h3>
<h4 id="1-user-pages-serve-out-of-master-branch">1. User pages serve out of master branch</h4>
<p class="lang-highlight">I thought all GitHub repositories served off of the <code class="hljs">gh-pages</code> branch. This is <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/#user--organization-pages">not true</a>.</p>
<h4 id="2-there-are-multiple-ways-to-deal-with-unruly-subtree-pushes">2. There are multiple ways to deal with unruly subtree pushes</h4>
<p class="lang-highlight">If everything is going well, the 'standard' <code class="hljs">git subtree push --prefix output origin master</code> command works fine. But sometimes you'll see this:</p>
<pre class="lang-highlight"><code class="lang-bash hljs">error: failed to push some refs to <span class="hljs-string">'git@github.com:drewbo/drewbo.com.git'</span>
hint: Updates were rejected because a pushed branch tip is behind its remote
hint: counterpart. Check out this branch and integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g. <span class="hljs-string">'git pull ...'</span>) before pushing again.
hint: See the <span class="hljs-string">'Note about fast-forwards'</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> <span class="hljs-string">'git push --help'</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> details
</code></pre>
<p class="lang-highlight">You might not have the "served" branch on your local machine so it's not as simple as just doing <code class="hljs">git pull</code>. My three solutions, in order of how I try them:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Magic Command</p>
<p class="lang-highlight"> <code class="hljs">git push origin `git subtree split --prefix build_folder master`:gh-pages --force</code></p>
<p> I don't totally understand this but sometimes it works (h/t <a href="http://stevenclontz.com/blog/2014/05/08/git-subtree-push-for-deployment/">some blog</a>)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pull Request</p>
<p> Do the subtree push to a temporary branch and then merge that to master/gh-pages (whatever branch hosts your output files).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Delete gh-pages/master (remote and locally)</p>
<p> Then rebuild and push.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="3-dns-changes-take-time-to-propagate-chill">3. DNS changes take time to propagate. Chill</h4>
<ul>
<li>Any time you make DNS changes with your domain name, just wait a bit.</li>
<li>Maybe use the DNS Lookup Utility if you're <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/dig">impatient</a></li>
<li><a href="http://imakewebthings.com/blog/github-pages-email/">Don't screw up your email</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4-git-submodules-are-confusing-the-first-time-you-try-them">4. Git submodules are confusing the first time you try them</h4>
<p>Especially when you put submodules in submodules. <a href="https://chrisjean.com/git-submodules-adding-using-removing-and-updating/">This article</a> was a big help.</p>
<h4 id="5-always-check-gitignore-" class="lang-highlight">5. Always check <code class="hljs">.gitignore</code></h4>
<p class="lang-highlight">I was ignoring the <code class="hljs">output</code> folder in <code>.gitignore</code> which I seem to do pretty often. This was a boilerplate <code>.gitignore</code> from another project and many times you don't want to commit the output but if you're going to do the subtree push, you need it.</p>
<div class="footnotes">
1. <a name="footnote-1"></a> my even older deployment workflow involved zipping the output folder so I could more easily upload it to the remote hosting server and then copying it over the prior files. It was a huge pain but I made the move to GitHub hosting back in July.
