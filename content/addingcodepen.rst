This week, I've been spending my free time trying to read everything that `Mike Bostock`_, creator of the JavaScript visualization library D3.js_, has ever written. 
!END-SUMMARY!
I have a handful of trinkets that I've been experimenting with while I try to get a handle on the library so I've added a link to CodePen_ to the footer of my site in case you're interested in checking out what I'm working on. My `current project`_ is an extension of my last blog post and involves creating a new visualization (for me at least) for Ken Pomeroy's college basketball data.
