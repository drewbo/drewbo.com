I've been really busy the past month (hence the giant break in posts) but I have some good excuses! I'm also going to use this post to kick off a series of monthly personal updates mixed in with my more project-based posts.

!END-SUMMARY!

Here's why I wasn't updating for a month:

- I `ran a 50K`_.
- I started a `new job`_.
- My neighbor's apartment flooded...
- which led to `very minor damage`_ to our unit...
- but they still decided to `pull our floors out`_...
- so I've been `staying in a hotel`_ for a few weeks.
- I went to `Summerfest`_ with my family.
- I saw a `Nationals game`_ followed by a `Plain White T's concert`_.
- I showed my `Aunt and Uncle`_ around for their first visit to DC.

July and August should have some highlights as well but hopefully I'm back into my apartment soon and I'll have more time to spend with the site.
