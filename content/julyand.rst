So it's been a little while since I posted. From my last post: "...but hopefully I'm back into my apartment soon and I'll have more time to spend with the site."
This did not turn out to be true. Explanations for my absence in photographic form after the jump.

!END-SUMMARY!

Life:

- My original hotel was sold out one night so I had to move to a `new hotel`_.
- Went to Bosnia for a week for work. We `worked a lot during the day`_ but got to `explore Sarajevo`_ a little more afterwards. It's `incredibly beautiful`_.
- A quick stop in Luxembourg and a quaint train ride through `the German countryside`_ on the way home.
- Was supposed to return to my apartment but it `still wasn't fixed`_ so... `another hotel`_.
- `Finally back!`_
- Chicago for a `wedding`_
- Quick weekend in NYC where I accidentally switched bags with someone. His bag looked like `this`_ and mine looked `like this`_.

No hopeful proclamations this time about my next post. Just happy to have an apartment again.
